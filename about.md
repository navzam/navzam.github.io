Hello! I'm Nafis Zaman. After much deliberation, I decided to start writing here for a few reasons:
- I love learning and helping others learn any way I can.
- I always forget what I learn and want to be able to refer back to things.
- I couldn't pass up the opportunity to buy [nafis.dev](https://nafis.dev).

Currently I'm a software engineer at Microsoft in the Commercial Software Engineering organization, where I work with customers on Modern Workplace, Business Applications, and Identity problems. I interned at Microsoft in 2015 and joined full time in 2016. I live in Seattle, WA and work out of the Redmond office.

Feel free to reach me using the links at the bottom of the page, and thanks for reading!
